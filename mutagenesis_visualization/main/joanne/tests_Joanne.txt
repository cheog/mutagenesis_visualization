List of functions to test. Create new test_notebook for each different notebook'
you are testing.

code_demo: demo_fasta, demo_datasets, demo_pdbs
	check output type
	
code_3D: _centroid
			check that calculates the mean in each of the three dimensions
		_light_parameters()
			check that when it runs it does not give an error.
			A way to do it is to make an auxiliary function that tests if your function
			gives an error when running. Then assert that the output of the aux
			function is False, otherwise raise an error
				def _test_light_parameters_output():
				    error = False
				    try: 
				        _light_parameters()
				    except:
				        error = True
				    return error
		_array_to_pymol(array)
			check the output is what you expect
		_color_3D_scatter
			check the output is what you expect. You will have to create a fake dataframe.
			That dataframe would look like the ones we generate when we create and object 
			and do object.dataframe()
