Frank Hidalgo
--------------
Frank is currently a 5th year Chemical Biology PhD student at UC Berkeley. He is a self-directed and data-driven scientist interested in using cutting-edge computational techniques to solve problems at the interface between health and technology. After he graduates from Cal, he is looking forward to joining a multidisciplinary team where he can put the skills he has learnt in data science and biology at work.

Frank is also part of a non-profit organization called `Beyond Academia (BA) https://beyondacademia.berkeley.edu/`_ BA's mission is to empower graduate students and postdocs to expand their career options beyond the traditional academic track. Check out the events organized by BA on their website.

Sage Templeton
---------------
Sage is currently an undergraduate senior majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Public Health at UC Berkeley. She is interested in the analysis of living systems at all levels of organization: from genetic changes in minute proteins such as KRAS to the effects of our climate crisis on ppopulation health. Sage is an undergraduate researcher in the Kuriyan Lab studying protein stability in HRAS under her advisor Frank Hidalgo. After graduation from Cal in 2021, Sage plans to return to her home state of New Mexico to work in community health policy before attending medical school.
