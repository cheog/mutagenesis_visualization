Frank Hidalgo
--------------
Frank is currently a 5th year Chemical Biology PhD student at UC Berkeley. He is a self-directed and data-driven scientist interested in using cutting-edge computational techniques to solve problems at the interface between health and technology. After he graduates from Cal, he is looking forward to joining a multidisciplinary team where he can put the skills he has learnt in data science and biology at work.

Frank is also part of a non-profit organization called `Beyond Academia (BA) <https://beyondacademia.berkeley.edu/>`_ BA's mission is to empower graduate students and postdocs to expand their career options beyond the traditional academic track. Check out the events organized by BA on their website.

Sage Templeton
---------------
Sage is currently an undergraduate senior majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Public Health at UC Berkeley. She is interested in the analysis of living systems at all levels of organization: from genetic changes in minute proteins such as KRAS to the effects of our climate crisis on population health. Sage is an undergraduate researcher in the Kuriyan Lab studying protein stability in HRAS under her mentor Frank Hidalgo. After graduation from Cal in 2021, Sage plans to return to her home state of New Mexico to work in community health policy before attending medical school.

Joanne Wang
-------------
Joanne is currently a second year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley intending to major in Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in Neurobiology. She plans to work in healthcare or biotech in the future.

Last year as a freshman in UC Berkeleyâ€™s Kuriyan Lab, Joanne conducted research alongside her mentor Frank Hidalgo to assess the protein stability of various single-point H-RAS mutants. This semester she is working remotely from San Diego and has transitioned her focus onto a computational project. Joanne has learned and been using python to improve the ways mutagenesis data can be analyzed which is applicable to her previous work with H-RAS mutants.
